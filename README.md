A command-line toolkit for creatives.

## What's Here

> [!NOTE]
> This crate is a work-in-progress toolkit for supporting the entire process of creating static web content, from concept to deployment.
> The way the tools are organized will likely change in future versions of the crate.

### Color Palette Picker

The default entrypoint (via `cargo run`, or by running `aer` after `cargo install aer`) launches an interactive color palette picker based on [Oklab Colorspace](https://bottosson.github.io/posts/oklab/) relationships.

### Asset Processors

> [!WARNING]
> While these processors _are_ implemented within the `aer` library, they aren't _currently_ exposed via a command-line interface. Work-in-progress!

In addition to the interactive color picker, the `aer` crate exposes a collection of ["asset processors"](src/proc.rs) which can be assembled into a pipeline for compiling static websites.
